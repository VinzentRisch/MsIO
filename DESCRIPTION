Description: The serialization mechanism of R allows to save and load R data
             objects in a binary format, that can however not read by other
	     programming languages or software. The MsIO package supports
	     serializing and restoring or importing mass spectrometry data
	     objects to and from language agnostic file formats. The file type
	     can be defined and configured through a second argument `param`
	     of the export/import methods.
