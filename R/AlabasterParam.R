#'
#' The [*alabaster* framework](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/alabaster.base)
#' provides the methodology to save R objects to on-disk representations/
#' storage modes which are programming language independent (in contrast to
#' e.g. R's RDS files). By using standard file formats such as JSON and HDF5,
#' alabaster ensures that the data can also be read and imported by other
#' programming languages such as Python or Javascript. This improves
#' interoperability between application ecosystems.
